# Sales Dashboard & Country Clustering

## Project Overview

Key features include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Overview of key metrics (total sales, average price, quantity sold)
- Sales analysis by country and product line
- Deep dives into seasonal trends, pricing patterns, and country-specific insights
- Hierarchical clustering of countries based on product line sales share

The dashboard is built with **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, and includes interactive visualizations for intuitive exploration.
